Today we're going to learn a new language! Let's use this Do Now to preview it. Follow the directions below:

1. Go to the tab/file that says "CSS". On line two, change the number after `width` to a different number (keep the `px!`). What happened to the image of Drake?
2. On line 6 of the CSS, change the comes after `color` to green (or a different color of your choice). What happened to the text that says "Instagram" and "Drake"?
